          		These terms will automatically apply to you by downloading or using the app. Therefore, you should make sure to read them carefully before using them. You are not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You are not allowed to try to extract the application's source code, and you should not try to translate the application into other languages or make derivative versions. The application itself, trademarks, copyrights, database rights and other related intellectual property rights remain the property of selfart.</br></br>
          		Selfart is committed to ensuring that applications are as useful and effective as possible. Therefore, we reserve the right to change the application or charge for its services at any time and for any reason. We will not charge you for the app or its services unless we clearly tell you why.</br></br>
				You should realize that there are some things that selfieart won't be responsible for. Some features of the application will require that the application has an effective Internet connection. The connection can be Wi Fi or provided by a mobile network provider, but selfart cannot be held responsible for the application not working properly if you cannot access Wi Fi and you do not have any data traffic left.</br></br>
				If you use the app outside of Wi Fi, you should remember that the terms of your agreement with your mobile network provider still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for data traffic during the connection to access the app, or other third-party fees. When using the app, you are responsible for any such costs, including roaming data charges, if you use the app outside of your location (i.e., region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the payer of the device that is using the app, please note that we assume that you have obtained permission from the payer to use the app.</br></br>
				Similarly, selfart can't always be responsible for the way you use the app, which means that you need to make sure that your device remains charged, and that if the battery runs out and you can't turn it on to use the service, selfart cannot be held responsible.</br></br>
				With regard to selfart's responsibility for your use of the app, when you use the app, it is important to remember that while we strive to ensure that it is always up to date and correct, we do rely on third parties to provide us with information so that we can provide it to you. Selfiart is not responsible for any direct or indirect losses you may suffer as a result of your complete reliance on this feature of the app.</br></br>
				At some point, we may want to update the app. The app is currently available on IOS and system requirements (and any other systems we decide to extend the app's availability to) may change, and if you want to continue using the app, you need to download an update. Selfart does not guarantee that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and / or to the version of IOS installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates when providing the app to you. We may also want to stop providing the app and can terminate the use at any time without notifying you. Unless we notify you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you by this term will terminate; (b) you must stop using the app and, if necessary, remove it from your device.</br></br>
